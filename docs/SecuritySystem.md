# Security System

The security system switches enable an easier creation of home alarm systems using already available accessories. Security system switches have default HomeKit notifications associated with them.

## Appearance

The security system provides labelled buttons for the various armed/unarmed states as well
as a button to trigger an alarm.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "bridge": {
      ...
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "AutomationSwitches",
      "switches": [
        {
          "type": "security",
          "name": "My DIY security system",
          "default": "unarmed",
          "stored": false,
          "zones": [
            "Living room", 
            "Bedroom", 
            "Back door"
          ],
          "armAwayButtonLabel": "Arm Away",
          "armNightButtonLabel": "Arm Night",
          "armStayButtonLabel": "Arm Stay",
          "turnOffZonesWhenDisarming": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Options

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| type | Yes | Set this to ```security``` to make this entry a security system. |
| name | Yes | Set this to the name of the security system as you want it to appear in HomeKit apps. |
| default | No | This configures the default state of the security system if it is not yet stored, never stored or the storage has become faulty. Set this to ```unarmed```, or ```armed-away```, ```armed-stay``` or ```armed-night``` depending on your needs. By default a security system is ```unarmed``` if this is not specified. |
| stored | No | The state of security systems are by default stored. Set this to ```false``` if you do not want the security system to retain its armed/unarmed and alarm state across restarts. |
| zones | No | A list of "alarm zones". Each zone will have it's own switch to trigger the alarm. The support for zones will help you detect what has caused the alarm and what to do about it. |
| armAwayButtonLabel | No | The label of the button to Arm the alarm in the "Away" mode (Default "[Name] Arm Away") |
| armNightButtonLabel | No | The label of the button to Arm the alarm in the "Night" mode (Default "[Name] Arm Night") |
| armStayButtonLabel | No | The label of the button to Arm the alarm in the "Home" mode (Default "[Name]Arm Stay") |
| turnOffZonesWhenDisarming  | No | Set this to ```true``` to turn off all the zones when disarming the alarm |

See [configuration](Configuration.md) for more advanced configuration examples.

## Usage

This is best used if you want to build your own home security system. Another use of this is to set up rules and conditions for smoke, leak or gas detectors and have different responses on the state of your home.

An additional use I have for this switch is to integrate with heating solutions and have centralized control over lighting, heating and security based on the mode of your home.

## HomeKit Notifications

HomeKit, by default, enables notifications for security system mechanisms. Once enabled you automatically get built-in notifications for this security system switch too. You can disable these notifications in the Home.app if you do not care for the notifications. To disable/enable the notifications, open the Home app, select the tile that represents the lock and long-press on it, choose Details and scroll down until you get to Notifications. You can disable them there.

There's unfortunately no way to change the notification text in HomeKit. If you're looking for something to send customized notifications I'd recommend one of the [IFTT plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=homebridge+ifttt) or my [homebridge-telegram](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/homebridge-telegram) plugin (shameless plug.)

## Arm the alarm when leaving home / Disarm when arriving home.

Starting from iOS 10, location based automations [cannot change the status of security devices in your home](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homekit-automation.2006433/). This behavior was apparently added to prevent automation being accidentally executed due to inaccurate GPS location.

Linking a location based automation to Arm/Disarm a Security System will make iOS asks the user to manually confirm before running the automation. 

This plugin exposes an ``Arm Away``, ``Arm Night`` and ``Arm Stay`` switches (named for example ``My DIY security system Arm Away``) to work around this limitation. You can now link your location-based automation with this switch to arm/disarm the alarm when leaving/arriving home.

Please note: the location of your phone might be inaccurate; use these switches at your own risk.

## Typical rules for the security system

The following is an example rule for the security system, showing the versatility:

```text
When motion detected
And Security System State is Night Arm
Then Set Alarm to ON
And Turn on all lights
```

In essence you can create rules for each of the security system states and respond differently if the alarm happens during the night, when you're at home or away by building appropriate rules for it.


## Example with multiple zones

The following is an example rule for the security system, using multiple alarm zones:

```text
When motion detected in the Living room
And Security System State is Night Arm
Then Set Living Room Zone to ON
```

```text
When motion detected in the Bedroom
And Security System State is Night Arm
Then Set Bedroom Zone to ON
```

## Example configuration

An example configuration of for the security system, which is ready to run, can be seen [in the examples folder](../examples/securitysystem/config.json).
