## Why do we need this plugin?

This platform provides software based, optionally persistent, switches to create DIY HomeKit solutions.
Each switch has specific purposes that are illustrated in their respective documents linked below.

The plugin provides four different types of switches: A basic on/off switch, a lock mechanism, an automation switch with advanced properties and a security system. All of them are configured ahead
of their use through the configuration file and each one of them potentially saves their state to storage
to keep their state even across crashes, reboots and such.

## Installation instructions

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:

 ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-automation-switches```

## Example config.json:

```json
{
  "bridge": {
      ...
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "AutomationSwitches",
      "switches": [
        {
          "type": "automation",
          "name": "Automation Switch #1",
          "period": 1800,
          "autoOff": false
        },
        {
          "type": "security",
          "name": "Home alarm"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The platform can provide any number of switches that have to be predefined in the homebridge config.json.

### Switch types

Please see the documentation for each type of switch this plugin is able to create:

- [Automation switch](docs/AutomationSwitch.md)
- [Lock mechanism](docs/LockMechanism.md)
- [Security system](docs/SecuritySystem.md)
- [Switch](docs/Switch.md)
- [Slider](docs/Slider.md)
- [Alarm Clock](docs/AlarmClock.md)
- [Solar Clock](docs/SolarClock.md)

An advanced configuration example containing all four switch types can be found [here](docs/Configuration.md).

### Storage

Every type of switch is able to store every state change to disk. This is useful if homebridge is restarted for whatever reason: The switches created by this plugin will retain the state they had before the restart.

For that the switches create individual files in the persist subfolder of your homebridge configuration folder.

## Developer Information

There's [documentation](docs/CustomCharacteristics.md) of the custom services and characteristics exposed by the switches.

## Supported clients

This platform and the switches it creates have been verified to work with the following apps on iOS 11:

* Home
* Elgato Eve
